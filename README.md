# ng-matsidenav_by_2

Using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.9

Proof of concept, hence the wild colour scheme.
This is a refactoring of an existing older project that suffered some bloat, trying to make more accurate the layout and use as much flex classes as possible.

## Development server and port selection

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve [--port 4200]    [part is optional]
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` or port provided. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Scaffolding

Angular CLI includes code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For help (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build will optimise your application for performance and speed.
